 by competent authorities to be a real archdeacon down to the very 
ground. And yet, as far as I can remember, I had not then even spoken to
 an archdeacon. I have felt the compliment to be very great. The 
archdeacon came whole from my brain after this fashion;—but in writing 
about clergymen generally, I *had to pick up as I went* whatever I might
 know or pretend to know about them" (80-81; asterisks mine).</p>

<p>"For I had introduced one Tom Towers as being potent among the contributors to the <em>Jupiter, </em>under which name I certainly did allude to the <em>Times. </em>But at that time, living away in Ireland, I had not even heard the name of any gentleman connected with the&nbsp;<em>Times</em>
 newspaper, and could not have intended to represent any individual by 
Tom Towers. As I had created an archdeacon, so had I created a 
journalist, and the one creation was no more personal or indicative of 
morbid tendencies than the other. If Tom Towers was at all like any 
gentleman connected with the <em>Times</em>, my moral consciousness must again have been very powerful" (86).</p></div>
