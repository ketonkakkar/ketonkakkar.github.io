I am a writer and computer scientist interested in technology, law, and daily life. I write prose, across genre, often about time, memory, and dislocation. I also hold a license to broker mortgages in the State of New York. For fun, I read books, climb rocks, and make pottery.

I love using computational thinking to analyze humanistic problems, and I think a whole lot of what we deem digital problems can be worked through with humanistic thought.

I enjoy correspondence! Feel free to shoot me an email about anything you wish. My address is displayed at the bottom of this site.

## What's next

Being 22 with few obligations, I think it best to spend my time on hard problems, with a view toward the long term. Right now I am most interested in: fixing [American apathy](/blog/2020/03/23/canaries.html), sustainable energy/finance, and implementing the reverse of brain drains.


## A patch in the fabric

Last spring I made a podcast about my parents' lives with [War News Radio](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/war-news-radio/id75012663) as the first part of a larger oral history on Afghan Hindu refugees. You can listen to it here.

Thanks to Jake Stattel, Rohit Nair, Kyle Richmond-Crosset, and especially [Will Reid](https://www.willreidradio.com/) for working on this with me.

You can also listen on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6YaaphVOC8tWg60l1DJN3m?si=NB8asEnbRyWdLC792hhgGQ), [Google](https://bit.ly/2WtveG5), [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/exodus-from-afghanistan-my-parents-story/id75012663?i=1000435336734), or likely wherever else you get your podcasts.
