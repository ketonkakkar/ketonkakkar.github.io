## About Me

I am a journalist and computer scientist interested in technology, law, and daily life. I write fiction, across genre, often about time, memory, and dislocation. I also hold a license to broker mortgages in the state of New York. For fun, I read books, climb rocks, and slackline.  

## A life update

I recently made a podcast with [War News Radio](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/war-news-radio/id75012663) about Afghan Hindu refugees. Check it out!

Thanks to Jake Stattel, Rohit Nair, Kyle Richmond-Crosset, and Will Reid for working on this with me.
