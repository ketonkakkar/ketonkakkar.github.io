I am a journalist and computer scientist interested in technology, law, and daily life. I write fiction, across genre, often about time, memory, and dislocation. I also hold a license to broker mortgages in the State of New York. For fun, I read books, climb rocks, and make pottery.  

I love using computational thinking to analyze humanistic problems, and I think a whole lot of what we deem digital problems can be worked through with humanistic thought.

## My current work

At the moment I am interning as an urban planning reporter at WHYY's PlanPhilly. Cities and their infrastructure undergird much of daily life. Understanding how they work, and sharing that understanding with others, strikes me as a necessary and urgent civic duty.


## A patch in the fabric

Last spring I made a podcast about my parents' lives with [War News Radio](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/war-news-radio/id75012663) as the first part of a larger oral history on Afghan Hindu refugees. You can listen to it here.

Thanks to Jake Stattel, Rohit Nair, Kyle Richmond-Crosset, and especially [Will Reid](https://www.willreidradio.com/) for working on this with me.
