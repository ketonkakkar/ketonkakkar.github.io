In the summer of 2016 I interned at Harvard's [Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu). While a Berktern I worked on the [Lumen Database](https://lumendatabase.org), which maintains an archive of online-content removal requests to protect against censorship. While there, I blogged about pertinent issues in technology law.

## Journalism

### Investigative reporting

In the spring of 2019 my college newspaper, The Phoenix, broke an investigative story on the misogyny and hazing practices of Swarthmore College's fraternities. Our articles got picked up by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/swarthmore-college-phi-psi-fraternities.html), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/30/close-rape-attic-swarthmore-students-occupy-fraternity-after-disturbing-documents-leak/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/02/718969495/swarthmore-fraternities-disband-over-leaked-documents-that-detailed-misogyny), and others. Shortly thereafter, both of Swarthmore's fraternities disbanded themselves.

Though an emeritus editor at the time, I was called upon to serve as acting editor and co-author in the investigation, due to a conflict of interest in The Phoenix's senior editorial board.

You can view the work of our reporting team here:

+ [Phi Psi Leak Suggests Evidence of Hazing](https://swarthmorephoenix.com/2019/04/18/phi-psi-leak-suggests-evidence-of-hazing/)

Transparency around process is a crucial part of building trust. Along with our investigative articles, we published an editor's note, to make clear to the Swarthmore community the validity of our reporting. You can read about it here:

### City reporting at WHYY News in Philadelphia

After finishing college in the fall of 2019 I spent a term interning as a reporter at WHYY, Philadelphia's NPR affiliate. I worked for the PlanPhilly team, which covers urban planning, among other things. Cities and their infrastructure undergird much of daily life. Understanding how they work, and sharing that understanding with others, strikes me as a necessary and urgent civic duty. Here is a selection of the work I did during that time.
