  <div class="post-content">
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am conducting an oral history of the Afghan Hindu diaspora that resulted from the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. According to “A Nation Displaced,” “During the 1980s more than 6 million Afghans became refugees”(Newland). The narrators and refugees that form the base for this project are spread across the world in locations such as New York, DC, London, Amsterdam, Hamburg, and Delhi. These refugees form a part of my extended socio-ethnic community, which fuels my desire to work on this. If you have any interest in assiting with this project, please contact me at ketonkakkar [at] gmail [dot] com. Similarly, if you identify as Afghan Hindu and would like to tell your story, please reach out.</p>

<h2 id="goals-and-audience">Goals and audience</h2>

<p>I am undertaking this project to preserve stories of migration, so my kids will know where they came from. I hope, in light of the contemporary refugee crisis, these narratives will help to remind people of the humanity in refugees. I also hope these stories will provide a better discourse surrounding the country of Afghanistan, which is most commonly associated with violence and terrorism. I imagine this project as a way for me to give back to the rich archive of stories that have shaped my development.</p>

<h2 id="theoretical-bases-and-models">Theoretical bases and models</h2>

<p>This project wil draw on notable works in the field of oral history as well as theories surrounding South Asian diaspora. The narrative style most suited to this work is the life history interview. By conducting life story interviews, I hope to create with the narrators a shared authority about what it means to be Afghan Hindu in a state of diaspora. Example of projects on which I will model mine are the Syrian Oral History Project, and Lenore Cohen’s The Silent Refugees. Other models include the Act Up Oral History Project and the Mapping Memories Project.</p>

<h2 id="archiving-ip-and-privacy">Archiving, IP, and privacy</h2>

<p>Interviews are being archived, in video, sound and text formats, with the Afghan Hindu Association, which operates out of Hicksville, New York. This association, being a premiere focal point for Afghan Hindus in America, will also be integral in connecting me with narrators. It is possible that McCabe Library at Swarthmore College will be able to archive the interviews as well. The interviews will be stored in .mp4 and .wav files, and the metadata for the interviews will consist of the date, time, location, interviewer(s), and narrators. Authorship on these interviews, in the spirit of shared authority, will be joint. Regarding privacy: life stories are intimate and personal. Before all interviews I will clearly present to the narrator what the goals and outcomes of this project are, as well as make it clear what I intend to do with each interview. Should they be uncomfortable with having their name be public, or even having their story shared, I will respect their wishes and act accordingly, either by making their interview anonymous or holding it altogether.</p>

<h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2>

<p>The bibliography of works informing this project is based on Joseph Plaster’s Fall 2016 syllabus for his course at Yale, “Interdisciplinary Approaches to Oral History Narrative,” courtesy of my collaborator Will Reid, Yale ‘19. It consists of works that will or are currently shaping this project. If you would like to recommend something, please reach out and I would be happy to take a look.</p>
